# Paper
The paper is currently titled "Stream Mining Algorithms for Sensor Data ClassiÔ¨Åcation" and is a work in progress. It has 3 authors, namely, Yue Dong (Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Ottawa), Philippe Paradis (Special Student at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Carleton University) and Nathalie Japkowicz (School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Ottawa).

# Authors' Contributions
* Yue Dong, Philippe Paradis and Nathalie Japkowicz were responsible for the various ideas presented in the paper and the design of the experiments.
* Yue Dong and Philippe Paradis are the two main contributors to writing paper.
* Philippe Paradis was responsible for implementing all the code that performs the experimental tests and produced the results. He also wrote the code to generate all the figures that illustrate experimental results or summarize experimental data (such as Fig 5 through 12 and Table 1).
* Yue Dong was responsible for creating all the figures that illustrate the processes and algorithms we introduce in this paper (such as Fig 1, 2, 3 and 4).
